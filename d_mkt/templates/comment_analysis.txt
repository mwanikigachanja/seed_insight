Certainly! Analyzing comments on social media can provide valuable insights into your audience's sentiment, preferences, and engagement levels. Here's a template you can use for comment analysis:

1. **Platform**: List all major social media platforms where your company has a presence (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn, YouTube, TikTok, etc.).

2. **Date**: Include a column for the date of comment collection. This will help you track comments over time and identify trends.

3. **Post/Content**: Provide a column to specify the post or content associated with the comments. This could be the URL of the post, the post ID, or a brief description.

4. **Comment Text**: Have a column to record the actual comment text. You may want to copy the comments directly from each platform to maintain accuracy.

5. **Sentiment Analysis**: Optionally, include a column for sentiment analysis. You can use tools or manual assessment to categorize comments as positive, negative, or neutral. 

6. **Engagement Metrics**: Depending on the platform, include columns for engagement metrics such as likes, replies, shares, etc., to provide context for each comment.

7. **User Information**: Optionally, include columns for user information such as username, follower count, or profile information to better understand the commenter.

8. **Topics/Keywords**: Create columns to note any recurring topics or keywords mentioned in the comments. This can help identify common themes or concerns among your audience.

9. **Action Required**: Use a column to indicate if any action is required based on the comment (e.g., responding to a query, addressing a complaint, etc.).

10. **Notes/Comments**: Provide space for any additional notes or comments regarding specific comments or trends observed during analysis.
