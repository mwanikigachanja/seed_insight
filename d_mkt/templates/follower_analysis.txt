Sure, designing a follower/subscriber tracking template can be quite beneficial for monitoring your company's social media presence. Here's a basic outline you can use:

1. **Platform**: List all major social media platforms your company has a presence on (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn, YouTube, TikTok, etc.).

2. **Date**: Include a column for the date of data collection. This will help you track the growth over time.

3. **Follower/Subscriber Count**: Have a separate column for each platform where you can input the current number of followers/subscribers. This can be either a cumulative count or you can break it down by daily/weekly/monthly increments for more detailed tracking.

4. **Growth Rate**: Calculate the growth rate for each platform compared to the previous period (e.g., previous day, week, month). This can be expressed as a percentage increase or decrease.

5. **Engagement Metrics**: Optionally, you can include columns for engagement metrics such as likes, comments, shares, retweets, etc., depending on the platform.

6. **Notes/Comments**: Provide space for any additional notes or comments regarding significant changes or events that might have impacted the follower/subscriber count.

7. **Graphs/Charts**: Consider adding visual representations such as line graphs or bar charts to visually track the growth trends over time.

Here's a simple example of how the template might look:

| Date       | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | LinkedIn | YouTube | TikTok | Notes              |
|------------|----------|---------|-----------|----------|---------|--------|--------------------|
| 2024-05-13 | 10,500   | 8,200   | 15,300    | 5,700    | 12,000  | 6,500  |                    |
| 2024-05-12 | 10,480   | 8,150   | 15,280    | 5,690    | 11,980  | 6,490  | Facebook ad campaign launched |
| 2024-05-11 | 10,450   | 8,100   | 15,250    | 5,670    | 11,950  | 6,480  |                    |

This template allows you to easily track the growth of your followers/subscribers across different platforms and analyze trends over time. You can customize it further based on your specific needs and the level of detail you want to maintain.
